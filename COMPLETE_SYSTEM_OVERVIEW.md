## 🔄 **TWO PARALLEL WORKFLOWS**

### **Workflow A: EXISTING System (Still Active)** ✅

```
1. Student Management → Add/Edit Student
   └─ /Student/Index (UNTOUCHED)

2. Enrollment → Enroll in Class Section
   └─ /Enrollment/Index (UNTOUCHED)
   
3. Student Fees → Assign fees to student
   └─ /StudentFee/Index (UNTOUCHED)

4. Fee Templates → Define fee structures
   └─ /FeeTemplate/Index (UNTOUCHED)

5. Payment (OLD) → Record direct payments
   └─ /Payment/Index (UNTOUCHED - but redirects to new)
```

**This workflow is STILL WORKING** - Nothing was removed!

---

### **Workflow B: NEW Invoice System (Added)** 🆕

```
1. Student Management → Add/Edit Student
   └─ SAME as before! /Student/Index

2. Student Course → Assign to Course Package
   └─ NEW: /StudentCourse/Index
   └─ Auto-generates invoice with course fee
   
3. Invoice → View Generated Invoice
   └─ NEW: /Invoice/Index
   └─ Shows course fee, supplies, carryover
   
4. Payment (NEW) → Record Payment
   └─ NEW: /PaymentNew/Index
   └─ Payment locks after confirmation
   
5. Promotion → Promote Student to Next Level
   └─ NEW: /Promotion/Index
   └─ Auto-generates invoice with carryover + late fees
```

**This workflow is NEWLY ADDED** - Running alongside the old system!

## 🎯 **HOW YOUR SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS**

### **Scenario 1: Using EXISTING System (Old Way - Still Works)**

```
User clicks: "Students" in menu

Views: /Student/Index
  ↓
Controller: StudentController
  ↓
Service: StudentService
  ↓
API: GET /sms/student
  ↓
Result: List of all students ✅

  ↓
Views: /Enrollment/Index
  ↓
Controller: EnrollmentController

  ↓
API Backend executes stored procedure:
  - sp_AssignStudentToCourseAndGenerateInvoice

Result: ✅ Payment recorded (Status: Pending)

Then user clicks: "Confirm Payment"
  ↓
Controller: PaymentNewController.ConfirmPayment()
  ↓
Service: PaymentNewService.ConfirmPayment()
  ↓
API: PUT /sms/paymentnew/{paymentId}/confirm
  ↓
API Backend:
  - Updates payment status to "Confirmed"
  - Sets IsLocked = true
  - Allocates payment to invoice
  - Updates invoice status

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW**

```powershell
cd D:\ALL2025\Sovantha_Project\HongWen_API\SchoolMS
dotnet ef database update --project smsAPI.Infrastructure --startup-project smsAPI.Presentation
```

This will create 7 new tables WITHOUT touching existing tables!

---

### **Step 2: Run SQL Script** ⏳
```sql
-- In SSMS, execute:
-- File: simplified_invoice_schema.sql
```

This adds stored procedures, views, and triggers.

---

### **Step 3: Insert New Permissions** ⏳
```sql
-- Run SQL from NEW_ENDPOINTS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
-- Inserts 10 new permissions
-- Assign to Admin role
```

---

### **Step 4: Test Complete System** ✅

#### Test Existing System (Should Still Work):
1. Go to `/Student` → Should show student list ✅
2. Go to `/Enrollment` → Should show enrollment list ✅
3. Go to `/Payment` → Should redirect to `/PaymentNew` with message ✅

#### Test New System:
1. Go to `/StudentCourse` → Should show assignment page ✅
2. Assign student to course → Invoice auto-generated ✅
3. Go to `/Invoice` → Should show invoice with course fee ✅
4. Record payment → Payment status: Pending ✅
5. Confirm payment → Payment locked ✅
6. Try to edit payment → Should fail! ✅
