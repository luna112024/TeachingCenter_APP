cd D:\ALL2025\Sovantha_Project\HongWen_API\SchoolMS

# Apply EF Core migration
dotnet ef database update --project smsAPI.Infrastructure --startup-project smsAPI.Presentation
```

Then run in SSMS:
```sql
-- Execute: simplified_invoice_schema.sql
-- Creates: 7 stored procedures, 4 views, 2 triggers
```

Then insert permissions:
```sql
-- Insert 10 new permissions (see NEW_ENDPOINTS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
-- Assign to Admin role
```
